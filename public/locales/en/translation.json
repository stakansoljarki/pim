  "about description": "is a construction company that implements projects with the use of composite materials, including composite reinforcement and FRP rebar. During the 6 years of our company's existence, we have successfully implemented a large number of projects both on the territory of Ukraine and abroad.",
  "characteristics title": "What is the reason behind choosing composite rebar?",

  "1d": "Its tensile strength is 2.5-3 times higher than the tensile strength of steel with an equal diameter.",
  "2d": "Its long durability increases the lifetime of structures 2-3 times (50-80 years)",
  "3d": "It significantly reduces heat loss",
  "4d": "It does not change its characteristics in the range from -70 C° to + 100 °C.",
  "5d": "It is corrosion resistant. This simplifies its storage and increases the lifetime of concrete.",
  "6d": "It is resistant to the aggressive media",
  "7d": "It does not create a shield for radio waves, mobile communications, and Wi-Fi",
  "8d": "It does not conduct electric current, is electric safe and not magnetized",
  "9d": "Its weight is 4 times smaller than the weight of steel rebar",
  "10d": "Rebar is sold in coils, which allows it to be transported in the trunk of a car",
  "11d": "Saving up to 30% when replacing steel rebar to composite rebar",
